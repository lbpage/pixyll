# Week 1 (1500 CALORIES)

## Breakfast:

### Blueberry Fiber Bowl 

# _360 CALORIES_

> - ¾ cup of Kellogg’s All-bran Cereal
- ½ cup blueberries
- 2 tbs slivered Almonds
- 1 tbsp ground flax seed
- 1 cup fat-free milk

This has been one of my favorite breakfasts so far. It looks like cardboard, but is surprisingly tasty and satisfying to eat. It's really easy on your stomach too. The flax was difficult to find but I found whole flax seeds in the baking section of my local grocery store. Grind them all up in a blender. I got a lot of these recipes from Flat Belly Diet. They are really creative with the food they use and always easy to follow.

## Lunch: 

### Open face Tuna Sandwich with Small Side Salad and Apple

# _355 CALORIES_

> - 3oz Canned chunk light Tuna (⅜ cup)
- 1 tsp Dijon Mustard
- 1 tbsp Plain nonfat Greek yogurt
- ¼ tsp Dill
- 1 Slice 7-Grain Bread
- 1 cup chopped romaine lettuce
- ¼ cup chopped carrots
- ¼ cup cherry tomatoes
- ¼ cup artichoke hearts
- 1 tsp Olive Oil 
- 1 small granny smith apple

Mix the first 4 ingredients and spread onto the slice of bread. I toasted my bread and added a lot of pepper. We had this with a small side salad. The recipe for that is listed underneath the Tuna Sandwich. Another Flat Belly recipe and it was really good, but after a few days, I never wanted to eat tuna again. I suggest pre making your lunches. It was hard to prepare it every day for lunch and is easier to grab and go. The artichoke hearts I used were canned and surprisingly delicious. Who knew pickled artichokes would taste good. I also douse everything with a good sprinkle of pepper. I love pepper. 

## Dinner:

### Salmon and Grilled Veggies 

# *460 CALORIES*

> - 4 oz Grilled Salmon
- 1 cup Grilled Vegetables : Eggplant, Zucchini, Bell Pepper 
- ⅓ cup Brown Rice
- 1 tbsp Pumpkin Seed

I bought 2 packs of frozen salmon. They are way less expensive than fresh salmon and they come in packs of 4. 

## Snack 1:

### Cottage Cheese and Nuts 

# _140 CALORIES_

> - ¾ cup nonfat Cottage Cheese
- 1 tbsp unsalted peanuts

## Snack 2:

### Vegetables Cheese and Crackers 

# _185 CALORIES_

> - 1 cup Sliced Vegetables: Bell Pepper, Cucumber, Carrot
- 2 tbsp Salsa
- 2 [Wasa Crackers](http://www.wasa-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/us/2013/03/multigrain-pack-new-350x243.jpg 
2 Wedges Laughing Cow Cheese)

I picked out 2 snacks to eat during the day. The first one we eat in between breakfast and lunch and the second one between lunch and dinner. Having them curbs your hunger until the next meal. It’s way easier to get through the day with a few snacks.

This all ends up being 1500 Calories. I also added on a desert because I love sweets and feel like a meal isn’t complete without one. I found a good Lemon Square Recipe http://www.fitnessmagazine.com/recipes/desserts/low-fat-lemon-bars/ . These are 85 calories each without powdered sugar and the make 16 squared. So with the desert it was all 1585 calories. I didn’t remember to take a picture, but I will try to start in the future.

#Weekend 1 (1520 CALORIES)

`All together this is 1520 Calories. The weekend meals I try to make fun and a bit hardier (within the allotted calorie limit) as a treat.`

## Breakfast:

### Avocado Egg Toast 

# _347 CALORIES_

> - 1 Slice Whole Grain Bread 
- ½ Medium Avocado
- 1 Large Egg (Poached, Fried Hard, or Over Medium)
- ¼ tsp Olive Oil (To fry egg if you want. I used cooking spray.)
- Pinch of Salt and Pepper
- 1 Clementine (Tiny Orange...I had to google it :( )

Toast your bread. In a separate bowl mush down the Avocado half. Spread it on your toast. Fry or Poach your egg. Sprinkle on the Salt and Pepper. Lay egg on your Avocado Toast. 

This was extremely good. It fills you up too. I did not do well with the mushy texture of the egg and avocado. I tried it fried hard and it was perfect for me. If texture doesn’t bother you then you should be fine.  I got this recipe and a few others from [eatingwell](http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/weight_loss_diet_plans/diet_meal_plans/7_day_diet_meal_plan_to_lose_weight_1600_calories). They had a few unique ideas that I liked on there.

## Lunch:

### Ravioli Soup 

# _378 CALORIES_

> - 2 cups Ravioli Soup 
- 2 Slices Baguette (¼ inch)
- 2 tbsp Cheddar Cheese

I used this Ravioli Soup Recipe [eatingwell](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252455/ravioli-vegetable-soup/ ). It was very good. 2 cups looks like a lot, but it is a low calorie soup. So eventhough you recieve a big portion. It will only just fill you up. 

## Dinner:

### Chicken Tikka Masala 

# _427 CALORIES_

> - 1 ½ cups Chicken Tikka Masala
- ¾ cup Brown Rice

I actually wasn’t too big of a fan of this recipe, but my husband loved it. I used this recipe [eatingwell](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250138/quick-chicken-tikka-masala/ . It was very filling.)

## Snack 1:

### Apple and Nuts 

# _249 CALORIES_

> - 1 Apple 
- 3 tbsp Unsalted Almonds

## Snack 2: 

### Hummus and Cucumber 

# _119 CALORIES_ 

> - 4 tbsp Hummus
- 1 cup Cucumber

The first snack is simple and easy to eat while you are running errands on the weekend. The second snack is is nice to eat while watching a movie or hanging with your family in the evening.
